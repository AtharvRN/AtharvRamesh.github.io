I am Senior (4th year) Undergrad in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.iith.ac.in) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/). My interests lie in Deep Learning, especially Computer Vision. I am also exploring Self-Supervised Learning, Speaker Recognition. Apart from Deep Learning, I am also quite interested in Robotics, Embedding Systems, Computer Architecture, Hardware and Signal Processing.
