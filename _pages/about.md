I am Senior (4th year) Undergrad in the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://ee.iith.ac.in) at the [Indian Institute of Technology Hyderabad](https://iith.ac.in/). My interests primarily lie in Deep Learning, especially Computer Vision. I am also interested in Speaker Recognition and Natural Language Processing. Apart from Deep Learning, I am also quite interested in Robotics, Embedding Systems, Computer Architecture, Hardware and Signal Processing. I am currently working on Cosmic Ray Detection in Astronomical Images under the guidance of Prof. [Sumohana Channapayana](https://people.iith.ac.in/sumohana/).
